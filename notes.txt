Chris – Page Layout & Architecture
You are now the primary builder for the website's structure. You will handle the design implementation and layout for both the Home Page and the Team Page.

Home Page Execution: Write the content and build the layout for the Quote box, Tax Benefit box, "Recent Humanitarian Activities" section, and the IPL profile background.

Team Page Structure: Build the structural skeleton for the "Our Team" page. This includes setting up the Big Photo section, the President & Leadership block, and creating the necessary placeholders for the other team categories so Tanish can populate them later.

Content Hierarchy: Finalize the text structure for the President & Leadership sections.

Deliverable: Fully constructed layouts for the Home and Team pages, ready for final data entry.




Devansh – Site Cleanup & Quality Control
Your role shifts to maintenance and quality assurance. You are responsible for clearing out old data and ensuring the site remains stable.

Site-Wide Cleanup: Execute the removal of all unwanted elements across the entire site. This specifically includes deleting all Hindi text, the "Love / Friendship / Humanity / Visitors" section, and any Friends Day content.

Visual Verification: Ensure that removing these sections does not leave awkward gaps or broken UI elements.

Responsiveness: Conduct mobile responsiveness checks to ensure the site looks correct on all devices after the cleanup.

Deliverable: A clean, error-free site with all legacy content removed.
